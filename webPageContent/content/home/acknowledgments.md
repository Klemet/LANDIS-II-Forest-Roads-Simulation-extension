This work would not be possible without the incredible project that is LANDIS-II, and without the care and passion that the LANDIS-II fondation have to make the project as participative and accessible as it is. I thank them all tremendously.

I would also like to thank Github users [BlueRaja](https://github.com/BlueRaja) and [eregina92](https://github.com/eregina92/) for their respective packages, [High Speed Priority Queue for C#](https://github.com/BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp) and [Supercluster.KDTree](https://github.com/eregina92/Supercluster.KDTree). Both packages were of tremendous use to improve the performance of the FRS module, and I highly recommend you to check out their work.
