To learn how to parameterize and use the FRS extension, take a look at the [FRS extension workshop](https://klemet.github.io/frs-extension-workshop/).

**The workshop will give you files, scripts, figures and examples to understand and use the FRS extension for your research**. It will also give you tips to better interpret the output data of the extension.

To know how to generate the parameter files for the succession extension and the harvest extension that you will use, please refer to their user manual.
