If you want to experiment with the module or test it, you can [download the example files](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Klemet/LANDIS-II-Forest-Roads-Simulation-module/tree/master/Examples), or try the [workshop](https://klemet.github.io/frs-module-workshop/).

To launch the example scenario, you'll need the [Age-Only succession](http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/age-only-succession) extension and the [Base Harvest](http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/base-harvest) extension installed on your computer, in addition to the FRS module. Just launch the `test_scenario.bat` file, and the example scenario should run.
